"Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were boasting about the size of their latest 
programs. 'Two-hundred thousand lines', said Tzu-li, 'not counting 
comments!'. Tzu-ssu responded, 'Pssh, mine is almost a million lines 
already'. Master Yuan-Ma said, 'My best program has five hundred
lines.' Hearing this, Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were enlightened."
--Master Yuan-Ma, *The Book of Proggramming*
